# Type Master - A Pokémon Type Quiz App by Isaac McGowan



## Project Overview

**Type Master** is a desktop application built with Google AI Studio Python and the Tkinter library, designed to help Pokémon fans master type matchups. This project provides instant feedback through an interactive quiz and includes a full, scrollable type chart for reference.

This project was a personal challenge to develop skills in:
-   GUI (Graphical User Interface) development with Tkinter.
-   Data management and structuring in Python.
-   Application logic and state management.
-   Packaging a Python script into a distributable `.exe` file using PyInstaller.

---

## Features

-   **Interactive Quiz:** Dynamically generated questions covering single and dual-type matchups.
-   **Instant Feedback:** Pop-up messages immediately inform the user if their answer was correct.


-   **Standalone Application:** Packaged into a single `.exe` file, requiring no installation of Python or other dependencies.
